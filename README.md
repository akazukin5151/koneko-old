Note: this is the old repo for [koneko](https://github.com/twenty5151/koneko). You shouldn't need it except to look at the history

As for why I made a new repo, it's because I was messing around git-filter-repo (trying to remove htmlcov/ and testing/htmlcov/), but I decided I don't like how the new `git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all` and [network](https://github.com/twenty5151/koneko-old/network) looked, plus it doubled the number of commits. But I can't/don't know how to revert the old branch.
