Requires [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) on Linux. It uses the magical `kitty +kitten icat` 'kitten' to display images. For more info see the [kitty documentation](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/icat.html). Actually, `lscat.py` uses [pixcat](https://github.com/mirukana/pixcat), which is a Python API for icat.

**Why the name Koneko?** Koneko (こねこ) means kitten, which is what `icat` is, a kitty `+kitten`


# Features
See the [manual](#manual) for more details

1. Artist illustrations gallery
    * Enter the post's coordinates to open it in image view. Coordinates are in the form `xy` where x is column and y is row.
    * Next and previous pages
2. Image view
    * View an image in large resolution
    * Browse through different images in a multi-image post.
3. Browse the artists you are following, and view their illustrations (goes to 1)
4. Search for an artist, and view their illustrations (goes to 1)
5. Browse illustrations from all the artists you are following
* Both gallery and image views can:
    * Download an image([PixivUtil](https://github.com/Nandaka/PixivUtil2/) would be more suitable for batch download) in full resolution
    * Open post in browser


# Rationale
* Terminal user interfaces are minimalist, fast, and doesn't load Javascript that slows down your entire browser or track you
    * Image loading is *so* much faster, especially if you don't delete the cache

I get 32 trackers on Pixiv. Plus, you have to disable ublock if you ever get logged out

<a href="url"><img src="pics/pixiv_ublock.png" height="350"></a>

The mobile app even directly tells you Google "and our 198 partners" "collect and use data"! See [prompt 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twenty5151/koneko/master/pics/ads1.png), [prompt 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twenty5151/koneko/master/pics/ads2.png) (Github can't render the images correctly for some reason) and this [list](#trackers)

* TUIs make you cool
* TUIs *with embedded pictures* make you even cooler
* TUIs embedded with pictures of cute anime girls make you the coolest
* Keyboard driven
* Familiar, vim-like key sequences
* I use arch btw


# Usage
0. Install [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
1. Run (or if you use [conda](#conda)...):
```sh
# Use latest stable release (recommended)
# Update the tag for the latest released version
git clone -b 'v0.3' --depth 1 https://github.com/twenty5151/koneko.git

# Use latest master branch
git clone https://github.com/twenty5151/koneko.git

cd koneko && pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
cd koneko
./koneko.py
```

2. There are five modes of operation:
    1. View artist illustrations ([ex](https://www.pixiv.net/bookmark.php?type=user))
    2. View a post ([ex](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/78823485))
    3. View artists that you have followed (or any other user ID) ([ex](https://www.pixiv.net/bookmark.php?type=user))
    4. Search for artist/user ([ex](https://www.pixiv.net/search_user.php?nick=raika9&s_mode=s_usr))
    5. View newest illustrations from artists you're following ([ex](https://www.pixiv.net/bookmark_new_illust.php))

Enter digits 1-5 to proceed. If prompted, paste in an appropriate pixiv ID or url. See below for url examples.

Alternatively, you can supply a pixiv url as a command line argument to `koneko.py`, bypassing the first interactive prompt. The pixiv url must be either the url of the artist's page, or a pixiv post. Example:

```sh
./koneko.py https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/2232374 # Mode 1
./koneko.py https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/78823485 # Mode 2
./koneko.py f https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/2232374 # Mode 3
./koneko.py "raika9" # Mode 4
```
For more details look at the [manual](#manual).

# Roadmap

## Features

* Fetch json and compare with cache. If no new images, proceed. If there are new images, automatically reload.
* Image and User views should use lscat.py to render so alternate renderers can be used
* Image view should preview the next few images in multi-image posts
* For multi-image posts in image view, enter a number to jump to the post's page
* Option to use pillow or wand to edit numbers on pics
* Support [ueberzug](https://github.com/seebye/ueberzug)

## Speed

* Display each image as soon as they finish downloading (but due to lscat limitations, only one page at a time). Requires "integrating" (read: basically rewriting) lscat.py and threaded download functions

# Manual

```
Browse pixiv in the terminal using kitty's icat to display images (in the
terminal!)

Usage:
  ./koneko.py       [<link> | <searchstr>]
  ./koneko.py [1|a] <link_or_id>
  ./koneko.py [2|i] <link_or_id>
  ./koneko.py (3|f) <link_or_id>
  ./koneko.py [4|s] <searchstr>
  ./koneko.py [5|n]
  ./koneko.py -h

Notes:
*  If you supply a link and want to go to mode 3, you must give the (3|f) argument,
   otherwise your link would default to mode 1.
*  It is assumed you won't need to search for an artist named '5' or 'n' from the
   command line, because it would go to mode 5.

Optional arguments (for specifying a mode):
  1 a  Mode 1 (Artist gallery)
  2 i  Mode 2 (Image view)
  3 f  Mode 3 (Following artists)
  4 s  Mode 4 (Search for artists)
  5 n  Mode 5 (Newest works from following artists ("illust follow"))

Required arguments if a mode is specified:
  <link>        Pixiv url, auto detect mode. Only works for modes 1, 2, and 4
  <link_or_id>  Either pixiv url or artist ID or image ID
  <searchstr>   String to search for artists

Options:
  -h  Show this help
```

```

## Image rendering with lscat

**Note on terminology**: [lsix](https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/) is the name of the original shell script I used, which uses sixel. I edited it to use icat and renamed it **lscat**. Then I rewrote it with python, which is named **lscat.py**. **lscat.py is the default renderer and the fastest.**

You might have problems with image positioning with lscat.py. I wrote it to fit my screen and my terminal size, so there is no functionality to adjust for different terminal size. There are also 'magic numbers' (numbers that just exist) around. If you encounter problems, there are four things you can do, in order of least to most effort:

* Revert to the old lscat shell script.

    1. In `show_artist_illusts()` (`utils.py`), change `renderer="lscat"` to `renderer="lscat old"`.
    2. Note that Image and User views (mode 2, 3, 4) still use lscat. The responsible code are annotated with a `# LSCAT` comment.

* Revert to the original lsix script. This would be more reliable than 1., because it has all the checks for terminal sizes. However, you cannot use kitty; xterm works.

    1. Make sure you're cd'ed into the koneko dir, then `curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackerb9/lsix/master/lsix" -o legacy/lsix && chmod +x legacy/lsix`

    2. In `show_artist_illusts()` (`utils.py`), change `renderer="lscat"` to `renderer="lsix"`.

* Adjust the 'magic numbers'. They are commented in `lscat.py`.
* You can contribute to `lscat.py` by checking terminal size and doing all the maths and send a PR

| Feature  | lscat.py | legacy/lscat | [hackerb9/lsix](https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Speed  | :heavy_check_mark: | :x:\* | :x:\*
| Reliability (eg, resizing the terminal) | :x: | :interrobang: | :heavy_check_mark:
| Adaptability (eg, other terminals, tmux) | :x: | :x: | :interrobang:

\* lsix will appear faster because the images are much smaller. Once you scale them up, lsix will be the slowest.

# Contributing
* Fork it
* Edit the files on your fork
* Submit a pull request
* If you want to, you can create an issue first. Ask any questions by opening a new issue.

## Priorities
(As in, what I think I need help on and what you might want to focus on, not what will only be accepted. All PRs will be considered, regardless if it's important or not)

1. Speed: if it's slower than going to pixiv then half of its purpose is gone
    * The bottleneck is network IO and downloading images from pixiv
2. Reliable rendering: There's no point in browsing a media-heavy site on a text-only terminal
    * While it's working perfectly for my use case, it should work well for other reasonable cases (different terminal sizes, number+name for the gallery)

```sh
git clone -b 'v0.2' --depth 1 https://github.com/twenty5151/koneko.git
conda create -n koneko
conda activate koneko
conda env list                  # make sure you're in the correct environment...
conda install -n koneko pip     # and make sure pip is installed...
which pip                       # and pip is in your conda directory
cd koneko
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade --force
cd koneko
./koneko.py
```

## `Dev` branch

Use the `dev` branch for latest features, fixes, and unstability:

```sh
git clone -b dev https://github.com/twenty5151/koneko.git
```

## Unit tests
Use `pytest testing.py -v`. For type checking use mypy: `mypy koneko.py --ignore-missing-imports -v`


Here's a random shell command to get (but not download) and display any pixiv image url:
```sh
curl -e 'https://www.pixiv.net' "https://i.pximg.net/img-original/img/2019/12/21/20/13/12/78403815_p0.jpg" | kitty +kitten icat --align left --place 800x480@0x5
```
